 <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
 <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using
the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are named for their historical crescent
shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
